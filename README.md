<h1>Stream Hashtag</h1>

<p>This is an intermediary project that I'm going through to learn how to integrate a few technologies together
that I've never worked with. Namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Django REST Framework</li>
  <li>Celery</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter">twitter</li>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to create a site that watches a few Twitter hashtags, saves new Tweets into a Django app,
use Django REST framework to serialize the model and serve this information to an Angular app. Should be
a good learning experience</p>
